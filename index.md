## About Jo達o

Jo達o is a scientist slash hacker who just remembered how strongly he feels that only football players should be allowed to speak of themselves in the third person and will quit now.

I'm a physics PhD with a background in statistical physics and I spent the better part of the last 5 years telling a  computer (or a bunch of them) precisely how I wanted the tiny atoms to move around. For the most part, the computers were ok with this which is why I managed to complete [my PhD](#research) last year. I have since taken a break from pure physics and gone to explore the earthly realm of data science. Still, the tiny atoms will always be a part of my heart. And my arm. And my leg. All matter really.

I really enjoy programming. I love Python, hate that I know Fortran better than my own mother, and happen to think that Javascript is a pretty nice language (heresy, I know). I also think that anyone who has mastered Haskell must have somehow found out the cheat codes to the Universe, but that doesn't stop me from experimenting with it from time to time.

I live in Aveiro, Portugal, a pretty nice place to live, study, eat, sail, and occasionally get bored silly. In my free time I like to geek out, binge watch tv shows, and come up with increasingly more convoluted reasons not to sit down to write blog posts.

## Hacking

Here are some of the things I like to spend my time with

## Research
  
My field of research is in Statistical Physics and explores the use of Monte Carlo / Molecular Dynamics methods to answer things like: why does a ball-shaped molecule stop rotating madly when cooled, how much hydrogen can I fit into this rock, or when exactly does a liquid turn into a solid?

Have a look into my PhD thesis for more information:
