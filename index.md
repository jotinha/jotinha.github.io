## Jo達o Gomes Sousa

I'm Jo達o. I enjoy computers, data, math. 

I have a tiny online footprint, so your best bet is [email](mailto:web@jgsousa.com) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgsousa/) .

Offline, you can find me in Aveiro, where I live, Porto, where I work, or somewhere in between, probably stuck in traffic.

This website is an exercise on how to fail publicly at getting any writting done.

## Hacking

* [API to send SMS with uzo.pt]({{site.url}}/proj/uzo)
* [Breaking Bed Web App]({{site.url}}/proj/bb)
* [An Haskell Raytracer](https://github.com/jotinha/thrace)
* [WebGL map viewer for SWAT3]({{site.url}}/swatthree.js)

## Research

I also used to be a physics student. If you're into Statistical Physics and Monte Carlo molecular simulations you can read my PhD thesis:

*Sousa, Jo達o M.G., "Monte Carlo studies of phase transitions and adsorption: Application to n - 6 Lennard-Jones, C60 and zeolite systems", University of Aveiro (2014)* - [pdf](files/jgsousa.phdthesis.2014.pdf)
